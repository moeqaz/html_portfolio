                    <p>
                        I am currently 23 years old, pursuing a future in software development. Not long before enrolling for the 10-week coding bootcamp, offered 
                        <br>by Coding Temple, I often found myself feeling hopeless, with no direction in regards to a career. I was working at a Honda dealership and
                        <br>barely had any time to think about what I can do in regards to working towards a career. A couple of my friends had taken the same course 
                        <br>offered by Coding Temple, and recommended me to look into it. Eager to turn my life around, I had started practicing coding on freecodecamp
                        <br>and realized that, with a lot of practice, I can learn to code and build a promising future for myself. The car business wasn't going too well,
                        <br>as there is an ongoing car shortage, so I figured that it was the best time to make a switch.
                        <br>I was born in High Point, North Carolina and had moved to Baltimore, Maryland at the age of 8, and have been living here with my family
                        <br>since. I am the oldest of 5, with 2 brothers and 2 sisters. Growing up in a big family, many would describe me as family oriented, as I
                        <br>am very close with all of my family members, and never spare any opportunity to spend time with them.

                    <p><b><big>My Background</big></b></p>
                        <p>
                            I was born in North Carolina, but my family comes from Pakistan, which is located in Southeast Asia. I am my parents' oldest child, so growing
                            <br>up, my parents spoke Urdu in the house, so it had become my primary language. When I enrolled in school, I didn't know how to speak any English,
                            <br>and had to go through ESOL for the first couple of years. When I moved to Maryland, and started middle school, I found a few friends with similar
                            <br>backgrounds, and we all played cricket together, a sport which is a huge part of the Pakistani culture.
                            <br>As much as I really wish I went more often, I have only been to Pakistan twice. My mom, my 2 sisters and I moved back to Lahore for a year in 2005,
                            <br>but decided to move back shortly after seeing the living conditions over there. My most recent visit to Pakistan was this past January, and it was a pretty
                            <br>refreshing experience seeing how different life is over there compared to the life we live in the US.

                    <p><b><big>Why I Want to Become a Web Developer</big></b></p>
                        <p>
                            As I mentioned, I was previously employed as a sales consultant at a local Honda dealership. I had applied at Honda while I was working
                        <br>the overnight shift in a warehouse at a pharmaceutical company, making a little over minimum wage, with no direction in regards to 
                        <br>my career. I was depressed and anti-social, and knew that in order to grow, I had to break out of my comfort zone and try something new
                        <br>and I had always wanted to try working a job in sales. When I was hired, I was eager and had felt like I could've made a career out of it,
                        <br>but a few months in, I started feeling burnt out, as I was working 11 hours a day, everyday, including holidays. I knew I needed to make the 
                        <br>leap and apply for this course to start working towards an actual career that I feel like I will enjoy for as long as I pursue it.
                        <br>After not making a paycheck for 3 months due to the market conditions, as I was unable to hit my monthly quota of vehicles sold, it motivated 
                        <br>me to start working towards a career that will provide me the peace of mind of a guaranteed paycheck. I might not be able to make as much 
                        <br>as I used to, but I know I won't be spending as much time in a toxic work environment, and will have more time to spend with those I love.
                        </p>
